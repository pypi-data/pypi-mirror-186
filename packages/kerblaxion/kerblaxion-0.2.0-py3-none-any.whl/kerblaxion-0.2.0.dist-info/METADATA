# KERBLAXION #

Space Invaders + Galaxian Clone

## Installation ##

KERBLAXION currently requires [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/). In theory, it will also work with newer versions of Python after [pygame's incompatibilities with Python 3.11 have been fixed](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/3522).

The latest stable version of KERBLAXION is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/kerblaxion/), which means it can be installed with either [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). We recommend using `pipx` because it will install the game within its own isolated environment:

```shell
pipx install kerblaxion
```

Afterwards, you can run the game via:

```shell
kerblaxion
```
