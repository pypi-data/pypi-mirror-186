## Typing stubs for flake8-bugbear

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `flake8-bugbear` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`flake8-bugbear`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/flake8-bugbear. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.
