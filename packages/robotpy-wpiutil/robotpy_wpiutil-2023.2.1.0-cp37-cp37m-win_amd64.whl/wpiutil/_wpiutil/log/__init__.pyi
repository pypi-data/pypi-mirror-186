    """
    A data log. The log file is created immediately upon construction with a
    temporary filename.  The file may be renamed at any time using the
    SetFilename() function.

    The lifetime of the data log object must be longer than any data log entry
    objects that refer to it.

    The data log is periodically flushed to disk.  It can also be explicitly
    flushed to disk by using the Flush() function.

    Finish() is needed only to indicate in the log that a particular entry is
    no longer being used (it releases the name to ID mapping).  Finish() is not
    required to be called for data to be flushed to disk; entries in the log
    are written as Append() calls are being made.  In fact, Finish() does not
    need to be called at all; this is helpful to avoid shutdown races where the
    DataLog object might be destroyed before other objects.  It's often not a
    good idea to call Finish() from destructors for this reason.

    DataLog calls are thread safe.  DataLog uses a typical multiple-supplier,
    single-consumer setup.  Writes to the log are atomic, but there is no
    guaranteed order in the log when multiple threads are writing to it;
    whichever thread grabs the write mutex first will get written first.
    For this reason (as well as the fact that timestamps can be set to
    arbitrary values), records in the log are not guaranteed to be sorted by
    timestamp.
