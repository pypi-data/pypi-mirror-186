In order to use this API, you will need to import the `wearipedia` module:\n\n```python\nimport wearipedia\n```\n\nOnce you have imported the `wearipedia` module, accessing data from any wearable device is as easy as:\n\n```python\ndevice = wearipedia.get_device("whoop/whoop_4")\ndevice.authenticate({"email": "joesmith@gmail.com", "password": "foobar"})\n\n# data is a DataFrame\ndata = device.get_data("metrics")\n```\n\nIf you don\'t have access to your device, or need to demo data from a device without revealing your sensitive data or getting a device yourself, you can generate synthetic data, as shown below:\n\n```python\ndevice = wearipedia.get_device("whoop/whoop_4")\n\n# data is an automatically generated DataFrame\ndata = device.get_data("metrics")\n```\n\nand you\'re done!\n\n## Installing\n\nThe easiest way to install wearipedia is to use pip:\n\n`pip install wearipedia`\n\nWe currently support Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.\n\n## Supported Devices\n\nWearipedia supports the following devices:\n\n| Company | Model Name | Description | Example Notebook | Kinds of Data Available | Unique name |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| [Whoop](https://www.whoop.com/) | Whoop | The WHOOP 4.0 strap tracks sleep and activity data. | [Notebook](https://github.com/snyder-lab/wearipedia/blob/master/notebooks/whoop/Example%20Notebook.ipynb) | cycles, hr. | `whoop/whoop_4` |\n| [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/en-US) | Fenix 7S | The Garmin Fenix 7S is a watch that activity data. | [Notebook](https://github.com/snyder-lab/wearipedia/blob/master/notebooks/garmin/Example%20Notebook.ipynb) |  dates, steps, hrs, brpms. | `garmin/fenix_7s` |\n| [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/) | Pro CGM | The Dexcom Pro CGM wearable device tracks blood sugar levels. | [Notebook](https://github.com/snyder-lab/wearipedia/blob/master/notebooks/dexcom/Example%20Notebook.ipynb) |  dataframe. | `dexcom/pro_cgm` |\n| [Withings](https://www.withings.com) | Body+ | The Withings Body+ is a smart scale that tracks weight and other metrics (body fat %). | [Notebook](https://github.com/snyder-lab/wearipedia/blob/master/notebooks/withings/Example%20Notebook.ipynb) | measurements. | `withings/bodyplus` |\n| [Withings](https://www.withings.com) | ScanWatch | The Withings ScanWatch wearable device tracks sleep and activity data. | [Notebook](https://github.com/snyder-lab/wearipedia/blob/master/notebooks/withings/Example%20Notebook.ipynb) | heart_rates, sleeps. | `withings/scanwatch` |\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information on how to use wearipedia, please refer to our [documentation](https://wearipedia.readthedocs.io).\n\n## Citing\n\nA paper is in progress!\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis project is currently in *alpha*. This means that formal tests are not yet integrated, and the codebase is still really a prototype. Expect for most things to work, but also small bugs, rough edges, and sparse documentation.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAs Wearipedia is still at an early stage, we are not yet accepting contributions from the broader community. Once Wearipedia reaches its first stable release, we will begin accepting contributions.\n\n## License\n\nWearipedia is released under the MIT license.\n\n## Credits [![ðŸš€ Your next Python package needs a bleeding-edge project structure.](https://img.shields.io/badge/python--package--template-%F0%9F%9A%80-brightgreen)](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template)\n\nThis project was generated with [`python-package-template`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template)\n',
