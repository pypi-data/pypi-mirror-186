    'long_description': '# gitzip\n\nExport all the changed files between two git commits or branches to a zip file including\nthe directory structure.\n\n## gitzip usage\n\n`gitzip` allows to copy all files that changed between two commits (or branches) into a\nzip file.\n\nExpect a git repository being at commit `0c321f2`. If two new files are created, e.g.\n`README.md` and `docs/screenshot.jpg`, `git status` gives:\n\n```bash\n$ git status\nOn branch master\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)\n  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)\n        modified:   README.md\n        new:        docs/screenshot.jpg\n\n```\n\nAfter committing those changes, the command\n\n```\npython -m gitzip export.zip 0c321f2\n```\n\nwill create a `export.zip` file. This file contains all files that changed between commit\n`0c321f2` and the current `master` branch. So in the given example, the zip file will\nhave the following structure:\n\n```\nðŸ“¦export.zip\n â”£ ðŸ“‚docs\n â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œscreenshot.jpg\n â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md\n```\n\nThe files will have the contents that are currently checked out in the repository.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Via `pip`\n\n```bash\npip install gitzip\n```\n\n### From source\nTo run this program from the code directly, [`python`](https://www.python.org/) and\n[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) (`pip install poetry`) are required. Clone or\ndownload the repository.\n\nTo install all the dependencies, use your command line and navigate to the directory\nwhere this `README` file is located in. Then run\n\n```bash\npoetry install\n```\n\n### For development\n\nFor development installation perform the [From source](#from-source) installation.\n\nFor installing new packages, always run\n```\npoetry add <pip-package-name>\n```\ninstead of `pip install <pip-package-name>`.\n\nLaunch the program either check out the [Execution](#execution) section or use the\n*Run and Debug*-side panel of VSCode.\n\nIf the interpreter of the virtual environment does not show up in VSCode, add it manually. The virtual environments are located in `{cache-dir}/virtualenvs/<venv-name>/Scripts/python.exe` where the [`{cache-dir}`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#cache-dir) depends on the operating system (`~/.cache/pypoetry`, `~/Library/Caches/pypoetry` or `C.\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\pypoetry\\Cache`).\n\n## Execution\n\nTo execute the program use\n```bash\npoetry run python -m gitzip\n```\n',
