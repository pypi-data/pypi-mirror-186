## About patterns in coding
They are useful, but only to some extent. Most of them are not suitable for 
real life applications. DDD(Domain-driven design) is one of the most popular ways of development
today, but nobody explains how to write most of DDD patterns in Python. Even if they do, life gives you another
issue that cannot be solved with a simple algorithm. That is why [Andrey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSNpJHMOU7FqjD4Ttux0uuw) created
a library for the patterns that he uses in his projects daily.

## Types of patterns
These are different use cases for the patterns implemented.

- Database - patterns for database/data layer interactions
- Events - projects with events or event-driven architecture

## Available providers
Providers are different patterns for external modules like SQLAlchemy or 
FastAPI.

- Alchemy(Database, Events) - patterns for [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) for both database and events
- Kafka(Events) - patterns in [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) related to events
- Internal(Database, Events) - internal is the type of provider that saves everything in memory(dict, list and all the tools within your app)
- Redis(Database, Events) - redis allows us to work with [Redis](https://redis.io/) memory database
