Summary: This is a library to authenticate users of a streamlit application that is embedded in a host application using AWS Cognito's access token.  An example use case would be an Angular application that has a streamlit app in an iframe. A user would first login to the host angular app and receive an access token.    The user would then use this access token to sign in to the embedded streamlit app.
