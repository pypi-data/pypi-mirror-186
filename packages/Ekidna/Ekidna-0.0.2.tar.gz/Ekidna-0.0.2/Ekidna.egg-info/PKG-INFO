This library contains functions for analysis of, primarily, data collected from 
electrochemistry experiment. Various functions may be useful beyond the scope of
electrochemistry.

Examples of tools include: baseline subtraction, pairplots, histograms, standard curve creators, smoothing, etc . . . 

The code is developed by researchers at Ekidna Sensing.

Change Log
===========
0.0.2 (January 12, 2023)
-------------------------
- Second Release

Notes:
------
Added a function called scatter_bygroup. This function creates a 2-D scatterplot on a matplotlib axis and colours the points by
a third variable. The user passes an axis object,  x,y,col arrays, and, if desired, a string representing a matplotlib colormap.
The default colormap is 'hot'.
