# Functions

This is a gigantic folder, with multiple functions for multiple use cases. The only folder that you will need, is [PythonFunctions](./src/PythonFunctions/).

## Documentation

Every file has it own documentation, which can be found here: [Documentation](https://python-functions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Outdated (ish) but local documents can be found here: [Local documentation](Documentation/ReadMe.md)
