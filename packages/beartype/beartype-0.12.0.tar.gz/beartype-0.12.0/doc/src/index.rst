.. # Leading TOC entry self-referentially referring back to this document,
.. # enabling users to trivially navigate back to this document from elsewhere.
.. #
.. # Note that the ":hidden:" option adds this entry to the TOC sidebar while
.. # omitting this entry from the TOC displayed inline in this document. This is
.. # sensible; since any user currently viewing this document has *NO* need to
.. #  navigate to the current document, the inline TOC omits this entry.
