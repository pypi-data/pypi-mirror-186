# percheron

Percheron is a data collation tool specifically designed to gather and collate the contributors for a release of the [Django](https://djangoproject.com) project. 

It gathers data from a number of sources, including the commits to the Django project itself, issue tracking, pull requests, and translations. 

For more information, read the [methodology](https://github.com/glasnt/percheron/tree/main/docs).

For usage information, see the [GitHub README](https://github.com/glasnt/percheron)
