%% Basic description of your project
%% This is a description-type environment featuring at least the Main Scope ,
%% the Core features and the description of the Documentation. For Followup
%% versions a Changelog item may be helpful.
\begin{scope}

  \item[Main scope:]~

    Application of multidimensional Galerkin POD for Uncertainty Quantification
    in PDEs with multivariate random parameters.
  \item[Core features:]~
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Setup of a 3D convection-diffusion problem with multivariate
        uncertainties in the diffusion coefficient
      \item Computation and evaluation of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)
        approximations
      \item Galerkin POD based on PCE and random snapshots
      \item Testing of the approximations
    \end{itemize}
    
  \item[Documentation:]~

	\begin{itemize}
    \item Preprint \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01055}{arxiv:2009.01055}

%% List of all people who contributed knwoledge and ideas rather than active
%% work on the software project, i.e. whose research results are affected. 
%% Especially think about those features in the code where papers are still
%% under revision or even in preparation.  
%% Applicants and developers may be listed here as well in addition to further
%% MPI Magdeburg affiliates.
%% This is a description-type list environment, where each feature is an item
%% and the item text is the list of signature lines.
