# nestifydict
A tool for parsing structured data (primarily nested dictionaries from json files). In particular it can flatten dictionaries, map flattened dicts to a template, and recursively get/set elements in nested dictionaries without a priori knowledge of the structure.

Please see our [Documentation](https://nestifydict.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), 
[Github source code](https://github.com/jaredjbeard/nestifydict), 
and install from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nestifydict/)
