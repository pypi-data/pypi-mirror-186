Geochemistry π is **a Python framework** for data-driven geochemistry discovery. It provides an extendable tool and
one-stop shop for **geochemical data analysis** on tabular data. The goal of the Geochemistry π is to create
a series of user-friendly and extensible products of high automation for the full cycle of geochemistry research.  

## First Phase
It works as a **software application** with a command-line interface (CLI) to automate **data mining** process with
frequently-used **machine learning algorithms**, which would further lower the threshold for the geochemists.

The highlight is that through choosing **simple number options**, the users are able to implement a completed cycle of data
mining **without knowledge of** SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FLAML, Ray packages.

Its models section, shown as below, provides both **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning** methods to process the
users' data, including four types of algorithms, regression, classification, clustering, and dimensional reduction.

The whole package is under construction and the documentation is progressively evolving.

## Join Us :)
**The recruitment of research interns is ongoing !!!**

**Key Point: All things are done online, remote work (\*^▽^\*)**

**What can you learn?**
+ Learning the full cycle of data mining on geochemistry data, including the algorithms in regression,
classification, clustering, and decomposition.
+ Learning to be a qualified Python developer, including any Python programing contents towards data mining,
basic software engineering techniques like OOP developing, and cooperation tools like Git.

**What can you get?**  

+ Research internship proof and reference letter after working for > 100 hours.
+ Chance to pay a visit to Hangzhou, China, sponsored by ZJU Earth Data.
+ Chance to be guided by the experts from IT companies in Silicon Valley and Hangzhou.
+ Bonus depending on your performance. 

**Current Working Pattern:**
+ Online working and cooperation
+ Three weeks per working cycle -> One online meeting per working cycle

Even if you are not familiar with topics above, but if you are interested in and have plenty of time to do it.
That's enough. We have a full-developed training system to help you, as a newbie of data mining or Python developer,
learn steps by steps with seniors until you can make a significant contribution to our project.
