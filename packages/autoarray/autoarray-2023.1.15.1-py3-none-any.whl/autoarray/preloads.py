        The w-tilde linear algebra formalism speeds up inversions by computing beforehand quantities that enable
        efficiently construction of the curvature matrix. These quantities can only be used if the noise-map is
        fixed, therefore this function preloads these w-tilde quantities if the noise-map does not change.

        This function compares the noise map of two fit's corresponding to two model instances, and preloads wtilde
        if the noise maps of both fits are the same.

        The preload is typically used through search chaining pipelines, as it is uncommon for the noise map to be
        scaled during the model-fit (although it is common for a fixed but scaled noise map to be used).
