# httplint

This Python library _lints_ HTTP messages; it checks them for correctness and reports any issues it finds.

It has been extracted from [REDbot](https://redbot.org/), which will eventually depend upon it. Unlike REDbot, it does not perform any 'active' checks by making requests to the network, and it does not have a user interface.


## Using httplint

To use this library in your code, you need to do three things: put the HTTP message(s) in a format it can understand, check those messages, and then interpret the resulting notes it gives you about them.
