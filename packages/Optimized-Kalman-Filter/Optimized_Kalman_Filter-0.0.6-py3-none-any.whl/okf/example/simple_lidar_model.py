'''
Definition of the simple 2D lidar problem, used to create the KF model.

The system state is its location and velocity (x,y,vx,vy).
The dynamics model is a constant-velocity motion.
The observation model is a single sensor with known location that observes the location (x,y).
The goal is to predict either the state (x,y,vx,vy) or the location (x,y).
