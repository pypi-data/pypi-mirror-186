Contributing documentation
==========================

Documentation consists of several things.

1. Method/Class documentation that is to be
   documented *in* the code.
2. Hard-coded documentation in ``docs/api/*.rst`` files.
   These files are only contained in the on-line documentation.
3. Header strings in modules are documentation shown when users
   execute ``help(sisl.module)`` which may take a different
   form than the online documentation.
