## Discrete cracking within a shear zone

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bmcs-group/bmcs_shear_zone.git/master?filepath=notebooks/papers/automatic_cdt_2023/cdt_impl_concept.ipynb) 


The package includes the DIC driven modeling of the crack
localization in the shear zone. The notebook demonstrating 
showing the mathematical formulation and the implementation
concept, including examples can be launched 

The project implements a discrete crack propagation through 
a two dimensional domain cut out from a shear zone of a bended beam.  

[Crack propagation app](bmcs_shear/shear_crack/crack_propagation.ipynb)

The model has been developed by using a sketch 
in [notebooks/shear_zone.ipynb]([notebooks/shear_zone.ipynb])
which uses a combination of symbolic derivation supported by 
the `sympy` package and numerical `numpy` and `scipy` functionality.

Individual model components have been derived step by step 
indicating the mutual dependeces. The model is developed
in the following steps. 
 * beam design
   * material models (to be integrated with bmcs_beam)
 * crack path
   * crack tip rotation
 * deformed state
 * ligament stress profile
 * crack tip shear stress
 * crack orientation criterion
 * crack extension
 * crack propagation

The directory [shear_crack](bmcs_shear/shear_crack) demonstrates the 
applied development process. Each of the classes is implemented
in a separate Python file, i.e. `beam_design.py` and its functionality is demostrated
in the corresponding jupyter file, i.e. `beam_design.ipynb`.
