Phoenix enables you to get to MLOps insights at lightning speed. Phoenix focuses on surfacing areas
that require critical attention and offers zero-config observability for model drift, performance,
and data quality.

**_ NOTE: Phoenix is under active development. APIs may change at any time _**

## Getting started

```shell
pip install phoenix
```

### Troubleshooting

If you are using an Apple M1 machine and encounter the error `Could not find a local HDF5 installation`, take the following steps:
1. Install HDF5 with `arch -arm64 brew install hdf5`.
2. Find the path to your HDF5 installation with `brew info hdf5`.
3. Set an environment variable with `export HDF5_DIR=/path/to/your/hdf5/installation`.
4. Retry the command you ran when you encountered the error.

If are you using an Apple M1 machine and encounter the error `incompatible architecture (have (x86_64), need (arm64e))` during installation (for example, while installing `hdbscan`), take the following steps:
1. Run `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` to install Rosetta2 in order to emulate Intel CPUs on your ARM machine.
2. Purge the `pip` cache with `pip cache purge`.
3. Retry `pip install -e .` from the repo base directory.

## Unstructured data

Phoenix takes advantage of UMAP and HDBSCAN to highlight segments of your data that are areas of
critical drift.

## Structured / tabular data

Phoenix surfaces up problematic features of your model with regards to drift, performance, and data
quality.
