We have two modules 
1) speedometer
2) logic_gates

1) speedometer:
	In this module you will find functions like 
		. getSpeed(distance,time)
			In this function enter distance in km as int and time in (hours,minutes) as a tupple
			and it will return speed in Km/h
		. getTime(speed,distance)
			In this function enter speed in km/h and distance in km and it will 
			return Time in 'hh:mm:ss' format
		. getDistance(speed,time)
			In this function enter speed in km/h as int and time in (hours,minutes) as a tupple
			and it will return distance in km
2) logic_gates:
	In this module you will find functions like 
		.And(a,b)
			In this function you should provide 2 binary numbers as strings and it
			will return a binary number as string after performing AND operation
		.Or(a,b)
			In this function you should provide 2 binary numbers as strings and it
			will return a binary number as string after performing OR operation
		.Not(a)
			In this function you should provide 1 binary numbers as strings and it
			will return a binary number as string after performing NOT operation
		.Nor(a,b)
			In this function you should provide 2 binary numbers as strings and it
			will return a binary number as string after performing NOR operation
		.Nand(a,b)
			In this function you should provide 2 binary numbers as strings and it
			will return a binary number as string after performing NAND operation
		.Xor(a,b)
			In this function you should provide 2 binary numbers as strings and it
			will return a binary number as string after performing XOR operation
		.Xnor(a,b)
			In this function you should provide 2 binary numbers as strings and it
			will return a binary number as string after performing XNOR operation
