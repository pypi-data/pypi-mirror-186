This is a toolbox in form of a python package that contains algorithms to be used in dsp (digital signal processing) projects.

This project is under active development and it will take some time until it reaches a certain level of maturity. Beware that backwards compatibility is not an actual concern and important changes to the API might come in the future.

functionalities.
