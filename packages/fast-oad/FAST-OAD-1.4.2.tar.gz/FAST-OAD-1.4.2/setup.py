This package is installed along with \n> FAST-OAD, to keep backward compatibility.\n> \n> Keep in mind that any update of these models will now come through new releases of FAST-OAD-CS25.\n> \n> To get FAST-OAD without these models, you may install\n> [FAST-OAD-core](https://pypi.org/project/fast-oad-core/).\n> \n> :warning: Upgrading from an earlier version than 1.3 may break the `fastoad` command line (no \n> impact on PythonAPI). See [this issue](https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/issues/425)\n> for details and fix.\n\nWant to try quickly?\n--------------------\nYou can run FAST-OAD tutorials **without installation** using our\n[Binder-hosted Jupyter notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD.git/latest-release?filepath=src%2Ffastoad%2Fnotebooks).\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n**Prerequisite**:FAST-OAD needs at least **Python 3.7.0**.\n\nIt is recommended (but not required) to install FAST-OAD in a virtual\nenvironment ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/),\n[venv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html), ...)\n\nOnce Python is installed, FAST-OAD can be installed using pip.\n\n> **Note**: If your network uses a proxy, you may have to do [some\n> settings](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server)\n> for pip to work correctly\n\nYou can install the latest version with this command:\n\n``` {.bash}\n$ pip install --upgrade fast-oad\n```\n\nor, if you want the minimum installation without the CS25-related models:\n\n``` {.bash}\n$ pip install --upgrade fast-oad-core\n```\n',
