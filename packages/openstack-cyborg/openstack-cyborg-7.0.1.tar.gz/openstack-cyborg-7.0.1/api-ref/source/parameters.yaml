    This is a list of dictionaries to describe requested accelerator resource
    by users, where users use keys to describe the resource_classes or traits
    and values to indicate its quantity or property. This is intentionally
    similar to extra_specs in nova flavor, and uses the same keywords for
    resources and traits. The key-value pair can either be a resource/trait
    or a Cyborg property. Cyborg property is of the form
    "accel:<key>": "<value>". The valid key-value pairs can be found
