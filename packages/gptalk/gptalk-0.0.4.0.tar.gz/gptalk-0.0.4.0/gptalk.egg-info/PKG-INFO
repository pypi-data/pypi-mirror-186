[LIST OF SUPPORTED LANGUAGES](https://github.com/0ut0flin3/GPTalk#languages)



## REQUIREMENTS


-In order to use GPTalk you need to :

-have your OpenAI's Api key inside the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.


-install `mpg321` (a mp3 player for linux) only if you are on Linux.




## INSTALLATION 

Install GPTalk using PIP: `pip install gptalk 0.0.4.0`

Upgrade gptalk from time to time with pip install -U so that you always use the updated and bugfixed version.


## USAGE

In addition to communicating with gpt3 using the text or voice it is also possible to define some aspects of its behavior and personal details, as well as those of gpt3, even yours.

Some examples:

***>>>***`import gptalk.gptalk as gpt3`

***>>>***`app = gpt3.CONFIGURE(<YOUR_API_KEY>)`  # OR: app = gpt3.CONFIGURE(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

***>>>***`app.input_mode = "speech"` # OR 'text'

***>>>***`app.AI_NAME = "Alice"`

***>>>***`app.HUMAN_NAME = "Bob"`

***>>>***`app.AI_GENRE = "female"`

***>>>***`app.AI_AGE = "32"`

***>>>***`app.AI_MOOD = "happy"`

***>>>***`app.AI_SPECIES = "human"`

then, save:


***>>>***`app.save() #will create a memories.json file in the same folder that will also store and remember previous conversations.Every time you run save(), memories.json will be replaced with new. You can just run directly run() in the next step to use already existent`

and,then, run the app:

***>>>***`app.run()`

Start talking ( or typing, depending by the mode you choose) ... As for 'speech mode', gpt-3  should respond in a moment, but several factors can influence (try more times if you fail, move closer to the microphone)


Say `goodbye` to quit.

AVAILABLE PARAMETERS  : `AI_NAME`, `AI_AGE`, `AI_HOBBIES`,` AI_GENRE`, `AI_MOOD`, `AI_SPECIES` , `HUMAN_NAME`, `HUMAN_AGE`, `HUMAN_HOBBIES`,` HUMAN_GENRE`, `HUMAN_MOOD`, `HUMAN_SPECIES`


If you want change speech language (en-US is default) use `app.language=<LANGUAGE_TICKER>` (before run)
