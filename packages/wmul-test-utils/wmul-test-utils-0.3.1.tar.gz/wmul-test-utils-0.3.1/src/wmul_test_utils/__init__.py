These are utilities that help with testing.

make_namedtuple creates one-off named tuples for concisely passing data from 
the fixture method to the test methods.

generate_true_false_matrix_from_named_tuple creates a list of true and false 
values, and a list of corresponding ids,
to be passed into a test fixture.

generate_true_false_matrix_from_list_of_strings is a convenience function
It takes a string name and a list of strings, and returns the true-false matrix
built from those values. 

assert_has_only_these_calls asserts that the mock has been called with the 
specified calls and only the specified calls. 

============ Change Log ============
01/17/2023 = Added generate_true_false_matrix_from_list_of_strings

01/11/2023 = Added assert_has_only_these_calls

10/01/2020 = Created.
