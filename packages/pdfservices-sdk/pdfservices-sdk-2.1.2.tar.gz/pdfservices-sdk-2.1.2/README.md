PDFServices Python SDK
=======================

The Adobe PDFServices Python SDK provides ML APIs. Currently, it contains only Extract API, for extracting elements and renditions from PDFs.

Adobe Document Cloud’s simple cloud-based APIs help you get up and running quickly. Once you’ve received your developer credential, download and set up the sample project. After you’re familiar with the APIs, leverage the samples in your own server-side code.
