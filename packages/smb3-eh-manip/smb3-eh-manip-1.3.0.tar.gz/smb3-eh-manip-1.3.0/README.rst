Ingest video data from a capture card to render a smb3 eh TAS

Installation
------------

Navigate to the most recent versioned release here:

https://github.com/narfman0/smb3-eh-manip/tags

Download the zip and extract to your favorite directory.

Quick Start
-----------

Copy the config.ini.sample file config.ini.

There are two methods to configure the tool, using video capture
card and/or using a retrospy/arduino.

Note: you can use video capture to detect reset/start and use
arduino to detect lag frames.

`Video Capture Configuration <https://github.com/narfman0/smb3-eh-manip/blob/main/docs/video_capture_configuration.md>`_

`Retrospy/arduino Configuration <https://github.com/narfman0/smb3-eh-manip/blob/main/docs/arduino_configuration.md>`_

Calibrating latency_ms is critical. There is some delay between game start
and when the tool thinks the game started, so we need to account for that.

Notes
-----

We need to maintain score to avoid or incur lag frames. The current TAS
skips lag frames in 2-1 and 2f but gets them in 2-2. So make sure your score
IS past the threshold in 2-2.

1-Airship is all about setting yourself up for
success at the end of 2-1. So get any of the following:
65660 before 243 firekill, bonk strats for EZ 243
65610 before 244 firekill
65560 before 245 firekill, fast strat
2-1: Skip the final goomba in 2-1 if you are ahead, or kill the extra pirahnas if
you are behind for the hundredths place.
2-2: A little hop before the hill helps control the speed variance. Get 2, 3,
or 4 coins for 50 modifications.
