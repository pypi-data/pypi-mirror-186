# Glorious
A [WIP] Python library to configure Glorious devices. A lot of the code comes from [this](https://github.com/korkje/mow) project, but I'm working on expanding it and adding more functionality.

## Usage
Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kbidlack/gloriously.git`

Move into the project directory: `cd gloriously`

Install the requirements: `python -m pip install -Ur requirements.txt`

Run the script: `python main.py`
