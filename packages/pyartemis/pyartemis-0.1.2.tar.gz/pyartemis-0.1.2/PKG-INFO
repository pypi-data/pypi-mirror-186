# Artemis: A Python Library for Feature Interactions in Machine Learning Models
**Artemis** is a **Python** package for data scientists and machine learning practitioners which exposes standardized API for extracting feature interactions from predictive models using a number of different methods described in scientific literature.

The package provides both model-agnostic (no assumption about model structure), and model-specific (e.g., tree-based models) feature interaction methods, as well as other methods that can facilitate and support the analysis and exploration of the predictive model in the context of feature interactions. 

The available methods are suited to tabular data and classification and regression problems. The main functionality is that users are able to scrutinize a wide range of models by examining feature interactions in them by finding the strongest ones (in terms of numerical values of implemented methods) and creating tailored visualizations.
