    """Read storage config from toml file.
    
    :param filepath: path to config file
    :type filepath: str
    
    :param kind: kind of config, default is storage
    :type kind: str
    
    :return: return config keys
    :rtype: tuple, (str, str, str, str): access_id, secret_key, endpoint, bucket.

config_file = "config.toml"

# read access key from config file
access_key_id, secret_access_key, endpoint, bucket = read_config(config_file)

# create client
client = Client(access_key_id, secret_access_key, endpoint, bucket)

    result, content = client.add(bucket, filename, "image/jpeg", file)

# download file
