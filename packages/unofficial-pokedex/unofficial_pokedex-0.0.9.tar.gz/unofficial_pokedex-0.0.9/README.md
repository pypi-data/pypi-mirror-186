## Description:

Below is how the program looks in action:

Be sure to only use letters and numbers and no special characters. Also be sure that the Pokémon's name is spelt correctly. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in the database not being able to find the Pokémon:

<br>
4. The home icon is the "Summary Button". It displays the summary of each Pokémon randomly selected from each game.
<br><br>
5. If a Pokémon's name appears here, it means that the "Evolves From Button" is active. Click on the Pokémon name to load and change the screen to information about the Pokémon listed.
<br><br>
6. The "Type Button" retrieves all of the strengths and weaknesses of the Pokémon's type. Similar to the Abilities and Attacks buttons, it is possible to scroll through the information with the next and back buttons on the screen the text is presented on. Each Pokémon has one or two types. So up to two Type buttons will be shown at a time.
<br><br>
7. If you don't want to hear the music, click the "Mute Button" to turn it off. If you would like the music back on, simply click the button again.
