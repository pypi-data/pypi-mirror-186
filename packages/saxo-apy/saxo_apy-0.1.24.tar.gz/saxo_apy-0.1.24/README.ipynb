    "The client supports OAuth Code flow and will automatically spin up a server to listen for the redirect from Saxo SSO. At least 1 `localhost` redirect needs to be defined in application config for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the client will use the _first available localhost redirect_ to run the server on (typically only 1 exists in the config).\n",
    "\n",
    "The client validates redirect urls in application config automatically. OAuth 2.0 code flow requires a fixed port to be specified on the redirect url. In case this is incorrectly configured, an error message will guide you to ensure app config is correct with OpenAPI:\n",
