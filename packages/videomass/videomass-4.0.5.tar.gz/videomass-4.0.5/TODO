- If you plan to refactor code and make it compatible only for
  wx.Python4.1.1/wxPython4.2.0, erase `TestListCtrl` class on
  youtubedl_ui.py. Also check all code that starts with wx.version().
  Note this operation leads to make Videomass code incompatible
  for wxPython4.0.7.

- Some people who use the Youtube-Downloader feature on Videomass,
  asked me why the file download can't be stopped using the `Abort` button.
  Actually downloads are stopped after pressing `Abort` button only after
  completion of a download in progress.
  Thus, it is not the download in progress that will be terminated but the
  processing of a list of queued URLs (if with more than one URL of course).
  Since this is a problem that can't be solved using the yt-dlp/youtube-dl
  APIs, I'm planning of removing this feature completely from Videomass.
  I expect some reaction and I will evaluate what people think of this.
