# Authorization is specified with the 'auth' dictionary:
#
auth:
  type: BASIC # one of NONE, BASIC, BEARER, HEADERS, PARAMS, or AWS4Auth
  uservar: USER
  tokenvar: PASSWORD
  # The other keys depend on the auth type.
  # BASIC:
  #   uservar: <the user name>
  #   tokenvar: <the auth token>
  # BEARER:
  #    tokenvar: <the auth token>
  # HEADERS:
  #    Each key, value is passed as a header
  # PARAMS:
  #    Each key, value is passed a a URL parameter
  # AWS4Auth:
  #    access_id: <access key id>
  #    secret_key: <access secret key>
  #    region: <AWS region>
  #    service: # the 2 letter AWS service name
  # Typically each value specifies an *option key* that will be defined in the connections.yaml 
  # config file.

# Pagination is controlled by the *paging* dictionary
#
paging:
  strategy: pageAndCount # one of pageAndCount, offsetAndCount, pagerToken
  page_param: page
  count_param: per_page
  page_size: 100
  # The other properties depend on which paging strategy is selected
  #
  # strategy: pageAndCount
  # page_param: <name of the "current page" parameter 
  # count_param: <name of the "requested page size" parameter
  # page_size:  the requested page size (int)

  # strategy: offsetAndCount
  # offset_param: <name of the "cursor offset" parameter>
  # count_param: <name of the "requested number of results" parameter>
  # page_size:  the requested count size (int)
  #
  # strategy: pagerToken
  # In this strategy a request will return a "next page token" inside the body of the last set of
  # results. You specify the JSON path to that value and indicate the parameter name to provide
  # the token in the next request.
  # token_param: <name of the "next page token" parameter>
  # count_param: <name of the "requested number of results" parameter>
  # pager_token_path: JSON path to the next page token in the result body
  # page_size:  the requested count size (int)

# The strptime format for parsing timestamps
dateParser: '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'

# Rate limiting. Use throttle:sleep to add a pause between API calls
throttle:
  sleep: 5  # number of seconds to pause after each API call
  
#
# Table definitions
#
# Each table definition maps an API request type to a table in the database. We can handle both
# GET and POST requests, and complex logic for determining the details of the API call.
# If an API supports paging then you must specify `supports_paging: true` and then the paging
# strategy defined for the API will be used.
#
tables:
# The name of generated table
  - name: users
    # the path to the API resource. You can use {param} syntax if variable values need to provided
    # in the API path. You populate these values via the `params` section (see below).
    resource_path: /v1/{org}/users 
    # If result records are nested inside the result JSON body, specify the dot-separated path
    # to find the result list inside the body using `result_body_path`.
    result_body_path: results
    #
    # In some cases you may want additional fields from the JSON payload that appear "above"
    # the result list to be cloned onto each row. Use the `result_meta_paths` attribute for
    # this purpose. Say your result looks like:
    # {
    #    results: 
    #      inner_value: [
    #         {
    #          field1: value1
    #         },
    #         {
    #          field1: value2
    #         },
    #      ],
    #      tag_name: "foo"
    #
    # So your `result_body_path` points to the `inner_value` list:
    result_body_path: results.inner_value
    # and you want to include column "tag_name=foo" in each record, you can specify the
    # path to this additional field:
    result_meta_paths: [["results", "tag_name"]]
    # Now your resulting records will look like:
    #    field1         tag_name
    #    ---------      ----------
    #    value1         foo
    #    value2         foo
    # You can supply multiple paths, and each path is a list of element names.
    #
    #
    # Specify if this API resource supports paging
    supports_paging: true
    # You can specific a distinct paging strategy for a single API resource, otherwise will inherit
    # from top-level.
    paging:  # see 'paging' dict above
    # Optional additional headers to supply to the API call. Below are examples from the AWS Costs Connector.
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1
      X-Amz-Target: AWSInsightsIndexService.GetDimensionValues
    #
    # Parameters
    # 
    # We support multiple ways to parameterize the API calls. The simplest case is providing 
    # static values to one or more URL parameters:
    params:
      sort_by: name
      deleted: 0
    # This will add `?sort_by=name,deleted=0` to every API call.
    # This works with resource path parameters also, like:
    resource_path: /v1/{org}/users
    params:
      org: AcmeCo
    #
    # A key feature is that a param definition can provide *multiple values*. In this case
    # the API will be called with each value of that parameter. For example:
    resource_path: /v1/{org}/users
    params:
      org: [org1, org2]
    # Will call our API with `/v1/org1/users` and `/v1/org2/users`. 
    # Many REST APIs are organized in a hierarchy, where you values from a "parent API" provide
    # the parameters to another API call. Github is a good example, where the API call
    # to retrieve the set of Orgs available to a user is a simple API call:
    # GET /user/orgs
    #
    # But if we want to get the list of ALL members of every Org that a user belongs to, then 
    # we need to call the Org Members API call with each org id in turn, like:
    #   GET /orgs/org1/members
    #   GET /orgs/org2/members 
    #   etc...
    #
    # To support this, a param can use a `sql query` to reference the values returned from another
    # API call. See the definition for the org_members API below:
  - name: org_members
    resource_path: /orgs/{org}/members
    params:
      org: sql@(select login from orgs)    
    #
    # The special syntax `sql@(<query)` is interpreted to run the SQL query against the database
    # to retrieve values for another API call. When the `org_members` table is loaded, the
    # `orgs` table will be loaded first, and then the Org Id's (via the 'login' column) will
    # be queried from that table and used in a series of calls to the Org Members API. These
    # calls can be nested indefinitely, so that table C can reference table B, which can reference
    # table A.
    #
    # Since we support SQL queries for parent->child lookups, we can also use basic queries to
    # dynamically populate a parameter. This is used in the AWS Costs connector:
    params:
      start_date: sql@(select cast((now() - interval 6 month) as date))
    # Any valid SQL functions can be used and the query can return a single or multiple values.
    # Note that for security that the query can only refer to tables within the current connector -
    # you cannot query data from other schemas and in fact schema qualified table references
    # (like "select col from sch1.tab1") will raise an error. 
    #
    # POST requests
    #
    # By default API calls use HTTP GET, but you can provide a post body to issue POSTs.
    # Use the 'post' dictionary:
    post:
      field1: value1
      sub_part1:
        - start: "08:00"
        - end: "12:00"
    # This dictionary will be converted to JSON and sent as the body of the request. 
    # You cannot directly parameterize the POST body, but you can refer to `param` values
    # that are themselves dynamic:
    post:
      start_time: ${start_time}
    # The `${}` syntax will be sustituted with the current param value with that name.
    # This works inside strings as well:
    post:
      filter: "date < ${current_time}"
    #
    # Copying parameter values to the output table
    #
    # If you want to include parameter values in the output table because they aren't
    # present in the API result, use the `copy_params_to_output` property
    copy_params_to_output: [Context, Dimension]
    # and provide a list of param names. 
    #
    # Refresh strategies
    # 
    # We support multipe strategies for pulling API resource updates after our initial table
    # load is done. The default strategy is 'reload', which simply loads all data again from
    # the API and replaces the existing table.
    #
    # Use the 'updates' strategy when you can parameterize the API call so as to request updated
    # records.
    refresh:
      strategy: updates
      params:
      # indicate a dictionary of params to filter the API results to only return new records
      # The 'value' can reference either system variables or use a "sql@()" select.
        key: value 
      # The system var `${timestamp}` can be used to get the "last record time", typcically to filter
      # for all records updated since that time. Like with JIRA:
    refresh:
      strategy: updates
      params: 
        jql: "updated >= '${timestamp}' and created > 2022-07-28 order by created"

#
# Defining Views
# 
# It is intended that Connector tables reflect the exact structure of API responses from 
# the source system. Rather than trying to transform data in place, instead you can
# simply create a VIEW against the raw data table. This VIEW will be re-created each time
# the source table is loaded. This allows an Connector author to create one or more "user friendly"
# views of data from a source system. A view can select specific columns, rename them, cast
# data to more usable types, or perform other types of transformations. You can join data together
# from multiple tables, etc... 
#
# The only limitation is that views can only reference tables defined in the current Connector.
# In fact table references should never include a schema qualification.
#
# The "views" property is a list of dictionaries, which each dict defines a view.
views:
  - name: simple_orders # the name of the view
    # a single or list of multiple tables that the view selects from.
    from: raw_orders_table 
    # the query should be the full SELECT statement for the view. The system will
    # automatically generate the "CREATE VIEW AS" part of the statement. The list of
    # tables in the FROM clause must match those in the `from` property.
    query: |
      SELECT 
         order_id as id, 
        order_warehouse_name as name 
      FROM 
        raw_orders_table
      WHERE
        order_date > (now() - interval 6 months)
