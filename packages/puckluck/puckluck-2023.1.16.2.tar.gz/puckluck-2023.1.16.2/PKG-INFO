# About

> NOTE: This package is very much in development and the API will likely change rapidly. I am working through the boundaries of what this library will and will not support, but I intend to support this in 2023 and beyond.

A python package to help harvest and build a database of advanced NHL stats from reputable sources. To my knowledge, there isn't a downloadable database like [Lahman for baseball](https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) in the hockey analytics space. This repo aims to help provide tools to build such a database with an eye towards

- Simplify the ETL/data ops task to build a data store
- ML tasks upstream
- Simple webapp dashboards
