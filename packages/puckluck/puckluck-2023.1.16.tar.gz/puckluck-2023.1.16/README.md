A python package to help harvest and build a database of advanced NHL stats from reputable sources. To my knowledge, there isn't a downloadable database like [Lahman for baseball](https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) in the hockey analytics space.

- Simplify the ETL/data ops task to build a data store
- ML tasks upstream
- Simple webapp dashboards
