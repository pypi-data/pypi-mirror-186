      "page": "PhD candidates attended a workshop hosted by The Alan Turing Institute's Research Engineering Group (REG) to get some hands-on experience working on scivision as a piece of research software. The task involved adding pre-trained models and datasources to the scivision catalog. Succesful submissions include two classification models, for flowers and butterflies, and related datasets.\n#### Notebooks:\n- [Butterflies](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/connections-workshop-examples/blob/main/ButterflyClassification.ipynb)\n- [Flowers](https://github.com/scivision-gallery/connections-workshop-examples/blob/main/FlowerClassification.ipynb)\n\nTo learn more about the REG at Turing, click [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering)",
