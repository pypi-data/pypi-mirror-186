*CDK constructs for [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), an extremely fast JavaScript bundler*

[Getting started](#getting-started) |
[Documentation](#documentation) | [API Reference](#api-reference) | [Upgrading from AWS CDK v1](#upgrading-from-aws-cdk-v1)

[![View on Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/badge?package=%40mrgrain%2Fcdk-esbuild)](https://constructs.dev/packages/@mrgrain/cdk-esbuild)

## Why?

*esbuild* is an extremely fast bundler and minifier for Typescript and JavaScript.
This package makes *esbuild* available to deploy lambda functions, static websites or to publish build artefacts (assets) for further use.

AWS CDK [supports *esbuild* with Lambda Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-nodejs-readme.html). However the implementation cannot be used with any other Constructs and doesn't expose all of *esbuild*'s build interface.

This package is running *esbuild* directly in Node.js and bypasses Docker which the AWS CDK implementation uses. The approach is quicker and easier to use for Node.js users, but incompatible with other languages.

**Production readiness**

This package is stable and ready to be used in production, as many do. However *esbuild* has not yet released a version 1.0.0 and its API is still in active development. Please read the guide on [esbuild's production readiness](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#production-readiness).

Notably upgrades of the *esbuild* minimum version requirement will be introduced in **minor versions** of this package and will inherit breaking changes from *esbuild*.

## Getting started

Install `cdk-esbuild`:

```
npm install @mrgrain/cdk-esbuild@3
```

If *peer* or *optional dependencies* are not installed automatically (e.g. when using npm v4-6), please use this command to install all of them:

```
npm install @mrgrain/cdk-esbuild@3 esbuild
```

### AWS Lambda: Serverless function

> 💡 See [Lambda Function](examples/typescript/lambda) for a complete working example of a how to deploy a lambda function.

Use `TypeScriptCode` as the `code` of a [lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda.Function.html#code):

```python
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";
import { TypeScriptCode } from "@mrgrain/cdk-esbuild";

const bundledCode = new TypeScriptCode("src/index.ts");

const fn = new lambda.Function(stack, "MyFunction", {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
  handler: "index.handler",
  code: bundledCode,
});
```

### AWS S3: Static Website

> 💡 See [Static Website with React](examples/typescript/website) for a complete working example of a how to deploy a React app to S3.

Use `TypeScriptSource` as one of the `sources` of a [static website deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-s3-deployment-readme.html#roadmap):

```python
import * as s3 from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";
import * as s3deploy from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-deployment";
import { TypeScriptSource } from "@mrgrain/cdk-esbuild";

const websiteBundle = new TypeScriptSource("src/index.tsx");

const websiteBucket = new s3.Bucket(stack, "WebsiteBucket", {
  autoDeleteObjects: true,
  publicReadAccess: true,
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
  websiteIndexDocument: "index.html",
});

new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(stack, "DeployWebsite", {
  destinationBucket: websiteBucket,
  sources: [websiteBundle],
});
```

### Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics: Canary monitoring

> 💡 See [Monitored Website](examples/typescript/website) for a complete working example of a deployed and monitored website.

Synthetics runs a canary to produce traffic to an application for monitoring purposes. Use `TypeScriptCode` as the `code` of a Canary test:

> ℹ️ This feature depends on the `@aws-cdk/aws-synthetics-alpha` package which is a developer preview. You may need to update your source code when upgrading to a newer version of this package.
>
> ```
> npm i @aws-cdk/aws-synthetics-alpha
> ```

```python
import * as synthetics from "@aws-cdk/aws-synthetics-alpha";
import { TypeScriptCode } from "@mrgrain/cdk-esbuild";

const bundledCode = new TypeScriptCode("src/index.ts", {
  buildOptions: {
    outdir: "nodejs/node_modules", // This is required by Synthetics
  },
});

const canary = new synthetics.Canary(stack, "MyCanary", {
  runtime: synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_2,
  test: synthetics.Test.custom({
    code: bundledCode,
    handler: "index.handler",
  });
});
```

## Documentation

The package exports various different constructs for use with existing CDK features. A major guiding design principal for this package is to *extend, don't replace*. Expect constructs that you can provide as props, not complete replacements.

For use in **Lambda Functions** and **Synthetic Canaries**, the following classes implement `lambda.Code` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda.Code.html)) and `synthetics.Code` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-synthetics-alpha.Code.html)):

* `TypeScriptCode` & `JavaScriptCode`

Inline code is only supported by **Lambda**:

* `InlineTypeScriptCode` & `InlineJavaScriptCode`
* `InlineTsxCode` & `InlineJsxCode`

For use with **S3 bucket deployments**, classes implementing `s3deploy.ISource` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-s3-deployment-readme.html)):

* `TypeScriptSource` & `JavaScriptSource`

> *Code and Source constructs seamlessly plug-in to other high-level CDK constructs. They share the same set of parameters, props and build options.*

The following classes power the other features. You normally won't have to use them, but they are there if you need them:

* `TypeScriptAsset` & `JavaScriptAsset` implements `s3.Asset` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3_assets.Asset.html)) \
  creates an asset uploaded to S3 which can be referenced by other constructs
* `EsbuildBundler` implements `core.BundlingOptions` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.BundlingOptions.html)) \
  provides an interface for a *esbuild* bundler wherever needed

### [API Reference](API.md)

Auto-generated reference for classes and structs. This information is also available as part of your IDE's code completion.

### Escape hatches

It's possible that you want to use an implementation of esbuild that's different to the default one. Common reasons are:

* The current version constraints for esbuild are not suitable
* To use a version of esbuild that is installed by any other means than `npm`, including Docker
* Plugin support is needed for building

For these situations, this package offers an escape hatch to bypass regular the implementation and provide a custom build and transform function.

#### Esbuild binary path

It is possible to override the binary used by esbuild. The usual way to do this is to set the `ESBUILD_BINARY_PATH` environment variable. For convenience this package allows to set the binary path as a prop:

```python
new TypeScriptCode("fixtures/handlers/ts-handler.ts", {
  esbuildBinaryPath: "path/to/esbuild/binary"
});
```

#### Custom build function

> 💡 See [Using esbuild with plugins](examples/typescript/esbuild-with-plugins) for a complete working example of a custom build function using this escape hatch.

Constructs that result in starting a build, take a `buildFn` as optional prop. While the defined type for this function is `any`, it must implement the same signature as esbuild's `buildSync` function.

```python
new TypeScriptCode("fixtures/handlers/ts-handler.ts", {
  buildFn: (options: BuildOptions): BuildResult => {
    try {
      // custom implementation returning BuildResult
    } catch (error) {
      // throw BuildFailure exception here
    }
  },
});
```

Instead of esbuild, the provided function will be invoked with the calculated build options. The custom build function can amend, change or discard any of these. However integration with CDK relies heavily on the values `outdir`/`outfile` are set to and it's usually required to use them unchanged.

Failures have to cause a `BuildFailure` exception in order to be fully handled.

#### Custom transform function

Constructs that result in starting a transformation, take a `transformFn` as optional prop. While the defined type for this function is `any`, it must implement the same signature as esbuild's `transformSync` function.

```python
new InlineTypeScriptCode("let x: number = 1", {
  transformFn: (options: TransformOptions): TransformResult => {
    try {
      // custom implementation returning TransformResult
    } catch (error) {
      // throw TransformFailure exception here
    }
  },,
});
```

Instead of esbuild, the provided function will be invoked with the calculated transform options. The custom transform function can amend, change or discard any of these.

Failures have to cause a `TransformFailure` exception in order to be fully handled.

### Upgrading from AWS CDK v1

This version is compatible with AWS CDK v2. For the previous, AWS CDK v1 compatible release, see [cdk-esbuild@v2](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/tree/v2).

To upgrade from AWS CDK v1 and cdk-esbuild@v2, please follow these steps:

* This version requires AWS CDK v2. Follow the [official migration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-v2.html) to upgrade.
* Update the package dependency to v3: `npm install --save @mrgrain/cdk-esbuild@^3.0.0`
* `esbuild` is installed as an optional dependency. If your setup does not automatically install optional dependencies, make sure to add it as an explicit dependency.
* Any use of `InlineCode` variations has to be updated. Previously the second parameter was either of type `TransformerProps` or `TransformOptions`. Now it must be `TransformerProps`.\
  If the passed value is of type `TransformOptions`, turn it into the correct type like this:

  ```python
  const oldOptions: TransformOptions = {...}

  new InlineTypeScriptCode('// inline code', {
    transformOptions: oldOptions
  });
  ```

## Versioning

This package follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), with the exception of upgrades to `esbuild`. These will be released as **minor versions** and often include breaking changes from `esbuild`.

### Npm Tags

Some users prefer to use tags over version ranges. The following stable tags are available for use:

* `cdk-v1`, `cdk-v2` are provided for the latest release compatible with each version of the AWS CDK.
* `latest` is the most recent stable release.

These tags also exist, but usage is strongly not recommended:

* `unstable`, `next` are used for pre-release of the current and next major version respectively.
* ~~`cdk-1.x.x`~~ tags have been deprecated in favour of `cdk-v1`. Use that one instead.

## Roadmap & Contributions

[The project's roadmap is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/projects/1) Please submit any feature requests as issues to the repository.

All contributions are welcome, no matter if they are for already planned or completely new features.

## Library authors

Building a library consumed by other packages that relies on `cdk-esbuild` might require you to set `buildOptions.absWorkingDir`. The easiest way to do this, is to resolve based on the directory name of the calling file, and traverse the tree upwards to the root of your library package (that's where `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` are):

```python
// file: project/src/index.ts
const props = {
  buildOptions: {
    absWorkingDir: path.resolve(__dirname, ".."), // now: /user/project
  },
};
```

This will dynamically resolve to the correct path, wherever the package is installed.

Please open an issue if you encounter any difficulties.

This approach can be useful for static website deployments, where JavaScript code should be placed into a subdirectory. *Cannot be used together with ``outfile``*. - ``buildOptions.outfile: string`` Relative path to a file inside the CDK asset output directory. For example ``{ outfile: 'js/index.js' }`` will create an asset with a single directory called ``js``, which contains a single file ``index.js``. This can be useful to rename the entry point. *Cannot be used with multiple entryPoints or together with ``outdir``.* - ``buildOptions.absWorkingDir: string`` Absolute path to the `esbuild working directory <https://esbuild.github.io/api/#working-directory>`_ and defaults to the `current working directory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory>`_. If paths cannot be found, a good starting point is to look at the concatenation of ``absWorkingDir + entryPoint``. It must always be a valid absolute path pointing to the entry point.

        :param entry_points: A path or list or map of paths to the entry points of your code. Relative paths are by default resolved from the current working directory. To change the working directory, see ``buildOptions.absWorkingDir``. Absolute paths can be used if files are part of the working directory. Examples: - ``'src/index.ts'`` - ``require.resolve('./lambda')`` - ``['src/index.ts', 'src/util.ts']`` - ``{one: 'src/two.ts', two: 'src/one.ts'}``
        :param asset_hash: A hash of this asset, which is available at construction time. As this is a plain string, it can be used in construct IDs in order to enforce creation of a new resource when the content hash has changed. Defaults to a hash of all files in the resulting bundle.
        :param build_fn: (experimental) Escape hatch to provide the bundler with a custom build function. The function will receive the computed options from the bundler. It can use with these options as it wishes, however ``outdir``/``outfile`` must be respected to integrate with CDK. Must throw a ``BuildFailure`` on failure to correctly inform the bundler.

        :param build_options: Build options passed on to esbuild. Please refer to the esbuild Build API docs for details. - ``buildOptions.outdir: string`` The actual path for the output directory is defined by CDK. However setting this option allows to write files into a subdirectory. For example ``{ outdir: 'js' }`` will create an asset with a single directory called ``js``, which contains all built files. This approach can be useful for static website deployments, where JavaScript code should be placed into a subdirectory. *Cannot be used together with ``outfile``*. - ``buildOptions.outfile: string`` Relative path to a file inside the CDK asset output directory. For example ``{ outfile: 'js/index.js' }`` will create an asset with a single directory called ``js``, which contains a single file ``index.js``. This can be useful to rename the entry point. *Cannot be used with multiple entryPoints or together with ``outdir``.* - ``buildOptions.absWorkingDir: string`` Absolute path to the `esbuild working directory <https://esbuild.github.io/api/#working-directory>`_ and defaults to the `current working directory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory>`_. If paths cannot be found, a good starting point is to look at the concatenation of ``absWorkingDir + entryPoint``. It must always be a valid absolute path pointing to the entry point. When needed, the probably easiest way to set absWorkingDir is to use a combination of ``resolve`` and ``__dirname`` (see "Library authors" section in the documentation).

Therefore the following values for ``copyDir`` are all equivalent:: { copyDir: "path/to/source" } { copyDir: ["path/to/source"] } { copyDir: { ".": "path/to/source" } } { copyDir: { ".": ["path/to/source"] } } The destination cannot be outside of the asset staging directory. If you are receiving the error "Cannot copy files to outside of the asset staging directory." you are likely using ``..`` or an absolute path as key on the ``copyDir`` map. Instead use only relative paths and avoid ``..``.

        :param esbuild_module_path: (experimental) Absolute path to the esbuild module JS file. E.g. "/home/user/.npm/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js" If not set, the module path will be determined in the following order: - Use a path from the ``CDK_ESBUILD_MODULE_PATH`` environment variable - In TypeScript, fallback to the default Node.js package resolution mechanism - All other languages (Python, Go, .NET, Java) use an automatic "best effort" resolution mechanism. The exact algorithm of this mechanism is considered an implementation detail and should not be relied on. If ``esbuild`` cannot be found, it might be installed dynamically to a temporary location. To opt-out of this behavior, set either ``esbuildModulePath`` or ``CDK_ESBUILD_MODULE_PATH`` env variable. Default: - ``CDK_ESBUILD_MODULE_PATH`` or package resolution (see above)

This approach can be useful for static website deployments, where JavaScript code should be placed into a subdirectory. *Cannot be used together with ``outfile``*. - ``buildOptions.outfile: string`` Relative path to a file inside the CDK asset output directory.

If paths cannot be found, a good starting point is to look at the concatenation of ``absWorkingDir + entryPoint``. It must always be a valid absolute path pointing to the entry point.

Files copied like this will be overwritten by esbuild if they share the same name as any of the outputs. - When provided with a ``string`` or ``array``, all files are copied to the root of asset staging directory. - When given a ``map``, the key indicates the destination relative to the asset staging directory and the value is a list of all sources to be copied. Therefore the following values for ``copyDir`` are all equivalent:: { copyDir: "path/to/source" } { copyDir: ["path/to/source"] } { copyDir: { ".": "path/to/source" } } { copyDir: { ".": ["path/to/source"] } } The destination cannot be outside of the asset staging directory.

          For example ``{ outdir: 'js' }`` will create an asset with a single directory called ``js``, which contains all built files. This approach can be useful for static website deployments, where JavaScript code should be placed into a subdirectory.
          *Cannot be used together with ``outfile``*.
        - ``buildOptions.outfile: string``
          Relative path to a file inside the CDK asset output directory.
          For example ``{ outfile: 'js/index.js' }`` will create an asset with a single directory called ``js``, which contains a single file ``index.js``. This can be useful to rename the entry point.
          *Cannot be used with multiple entryPoints or together with ``outdir``.*
        - ``buildOptions.absWorkingDir: string``
          Absolute path to the `esbuild working directory <https://esbuild.github.io/api/#working-directory>`_ and defaults to the `current working directory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory>`_.
          If paths cannot be found, a good starting point is to look at the concatenation of ``absWorkingDir + entryPoint``. It must always be a valid absolute path pointing to the entry point. When needed, the probably easiest way to set absWorkingDir is to use a combination of ``resolve`` and ``__dirname`` (see "Library authors" section in the documentation).

        - When provided with a ``string`` or ``array``, all files are copied to the root of asset staging directory.
        - When given a ``map``, the key indicates the destination relative to the asset staging directory and the value is a list of all sources to be copied.

        Therefore the following values for ``copyDir`` are all equivalent::

           { copyDir: "path/to/source" }
           { copyDir: ["path/to/source"] }
           { copyDir: { ".": "path/to/source" } }
           { copyDir: { ".": ["path/to/source"] } }

        The destination cannot be outside of the asset staging directory.
        If you are receiving the error "Cannot copy files to outside of the asset staging directory."
        you are likely using ``..`` or an absolute path as key on the ``copyDir`` map.
        Instead use only relative paths and avoid ``..``.
