# Coinglass API

## Unofficial Python client for Coinglass API

Wrapper around the [Coinglass API](https://coinglass.com/pricing) to fetch data about the crypto markets.
All data is output in pandas DataFrames (single or multi index).

**Note**: This is work in progress. The API is not stable yet.

## Installation

```bash
pip install coinglass-api
```

## Usage

Currently only supports the `indicator` API endpoint.

```python
from coinglass_api import CoinglassAPI

cg = CoinglassAPI(api_key="abcd1234")

# Get average funding for Bitcoin
fr_avg = cg.average_funding(symbol="BTC", interval="h4")

# Get aggregated OI OHLC data for Bitcoin
oi_agg = cg.open_interest_aggregated_ohlc(symbol="BTC", interval="h4")

# Get liquidation data for Bitcoin
liq = cg.liquidation_symbol(symbol="BTC", interval="h4")

# Get long/short ratio data for Bitcoin
lsr = cg.long_short_symbol(symbol="BTC", interval="h4")
```
