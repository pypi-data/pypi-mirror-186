This repository includes: 
* the source code of **AVICENNA** ([src](./src)),
* the scripts to rerun all experiments ([evaluation](./evaluation)),
* and the automatically generated evaluation data sets to measure the performance of both **AVICENNA** and _ALHAZEN_ ([data_sets](resources/evaluation_data_sets)).
