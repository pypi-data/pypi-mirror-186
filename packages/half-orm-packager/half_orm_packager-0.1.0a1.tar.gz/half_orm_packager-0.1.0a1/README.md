# halfORM packager (DEPRECATED)

## Warning

**THIS PACKAGE IS DEPRECATED**.

This project is still in an early alpha stage and subject to constant changes.

The `hop` command is now directly integrated into the
[half_orm](https://github.com/collorg/halfORM) package and the first
real alpha version of `hop` will be released with the upcoming 0.8.0.

## Installation

`pip install "half_orm>=0.8.0rc1"`

## Help

No documentation for the moment, but you can check https://github.com/collorg/halfORM/half_orm/packager/test/dummy_test.sh
to get the idea of how to use the `hop` command.

If you're using this project, I am interested in your feedback and comments.
