crossdeploy is a declarative approach to manage MLOps resources.

Simply define the desired state of the resources and the necessary steps required to get to that state are executed automatically.

Subsequent modifications to the resources are automatically created, updated or deleted based on dependencies inferred between them.

Under the hood, crossdeploy is a thin wrapper around provisioning engines such as Terraform or Pulumi (coming soon) to manage resources.
