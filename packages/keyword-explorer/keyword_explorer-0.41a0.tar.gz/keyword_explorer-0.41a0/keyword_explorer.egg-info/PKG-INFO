Explorer Apps
====================================
There are four applications in this project, _KeywordExplorer_, _TweetsCountExplorer_, _TweetDownloader_, and _WikiPageviewExplorer_. They, and the classes that support them, can be installed with pip:

    pip install keyword-explorer

**KeywordExplorer** is a Python desktop app that lets you use the GPT-3 to search for keywords and Twitter to see if those keywords are any good.

**TweetCountsExplorer** is a Python desktop app that lets you explore the quantity of tweets containing keywords over days, weeks or months.

**TweetDownloader** is a Python desktop app that lets you select and download tweets containing keywords into a database. The number of Tweets can be adjusted so that they are the same for each day or proportional. Users can apply daily and overall limits for each keyword corpora.

**WikiPageviewExplorer**  is a Python desktop app that lets you explore keywords that appear as articles in the Wikipedia, and chart their relative page views.
